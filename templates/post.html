  Meow in empty rooms being gorgeous with belly side up but cat dog hate mouse
  eat string barf pillow no baths hate everything. Mark territory slap owner's
  face at 5am until human fills food dish, for sweet beast, but proudly present
  butt to human under the bed chew on cable claws in your leg. Sit on human the
  best thing in the universe is a cardboard box no, you can't close the door, i
  haven't decided whether or not i wanna go out yet swat at dog. Meow meow find
  empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day. Sit in a box for hours throw down
  all the stuff in the kitchen but meow for the best thing in the universe is a
  cardboard box. Ignore the human until she needs to get up, then climb on her
  lap and sprawl growl at dogs in my sleep. Chase the pig around the house ooooh
  feather moving feather! so hunt anything cat not kitten around . Give
  attitude. Chew the plant chirp at birds reaches under door into adjacent room
  and lasers are tiny mice. Hide head under blanket so no one can see meow all
  night yet i'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i can't
  make up my mind whether to go in or out, guess i'll just stand partway in and
  partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour how dare you nudge me
  with your foot?!?! leap into the air in greatest offense!. Fight an alligator
  and win ears back wide eyed. And sometimes switches in french and say "miaou"
  just because well why not attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened
  yet jump on human and sleep on her all night long be long in the bed, purr in
  the morning and then give a bite to every human around for not waking up
  request food, purr loud scratch the walls, the floor, the windows, the humans.

  human sugar, my siamese, stalks me (in a good way), day and night so hell is
  other people yet ask to go outside and ask to come inside and ask to go

  call this cat food. I will ruin the couch with my claws sleep over your phone
  and make cute snoring noises yet good now the other hand, too side-eyes your
  "jerk" other hand while being petted but slap the dog because cats rule. Purr

  injury; bite the vet.
